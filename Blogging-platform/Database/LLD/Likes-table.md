### Queries and optimisation for likes table

```sql
CREATE TABLE likes (
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    blog_id UUID NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),

    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, blog_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (blog_id) REFERENCES blogs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```


### **Indexes & Optimization**


```sql
sql
CopyEdit
CREATE INDEX idx_likes_blog_id ON likes(blog_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_likes_user_id ON likes(user_id);
```

### **Conclusion**


This list covers:
âœ… **CRUD operations (Insert, Delete, Fetch)**


âœ… **Aggregations (Most liked blogs, User engagement)**

### Further optimisation ideas
- Partition likes table with primary key (created_at)
- PK created_at also allows like history tracking (reliking)
- Read replica queries redirection
